## npm Boilerplate
This repository is one of the simplest ways to test your npm packages from the get go. It's gets as simple as it can be - clone the repo, install all the necesary packages for dev server, and then install dependencies you'd like to test and thats it. Way faster than setting up for local node server every time.

To get it going, simply run set of commands which are:
```
git clone https://github.com/sobekcore/npm-boilerplate.git
```
```
npm install
```
install your dependencies now, and then...
```
npm run start
```

After all of that you are ready to go, every benefit of a node server should be working fine. Like importing or requiring modules, or running server-side JavaScript. Happy convenience usage for all of you.
